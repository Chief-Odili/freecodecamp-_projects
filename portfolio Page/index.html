        <h2> Calculator Project</h2>
        <p> A calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves creating a user interface with input fields and buttons to emulate basic calculator functionality. JavaScript is used to handle user interactions such as button clicks, perform arithmetic operations based on input, and update the display accordingly. CSS is applied for styling and layout, ensuring the calculator is visually appealing and responsive across different devices. This project enhances web development skills by practicing DOM manipulation, event handling, and implementing interactive features in a web application.</p>

        <h2> Tribute Page Project</h2>
        <p>I created a tribute page using HTML and CSS to honor Chinua Achebe, showcasing his life and literary contributions. The webpage includes sections detailing Achebe's background, notable works, and enduring impact on literature. CSS styling was applied for layout, typography, and responsiveness, ensuring the tribute is visually appealing and accessible. This project deepened my HTML and CSS skills while highlighting Achebe's significance in African literature and culture.</p>

        <h2> Rock Paper Scissors Project</h2>
        <p>I developed a Rock, Paper, Scissors game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for interactive gameplay. The game features a user-friendly interface with clickable buttons for player choices and dynamic result displays. CSS styling was implemented for visual appeal, including animations for game elements. This project enhanced my JavaScript skills by implementing game logic for outcomes based on player and computer selections, providing an engaging and enjoyable gaming experience.</p>
